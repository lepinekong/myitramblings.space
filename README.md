# I Apologize to my twitter followers

For years, I had been using #twitter for my personal jot noting space, overloading it with random thoughts sometimes at high velocity as they come in my brain and I need to put them down to discharge my thoughts but not forget them later.

Since I have created a new content format called the **ReAdABLE Human Format** I can now stop spamming twitter and apologize to my twitter followers :).
