# I Apologize to my twitter followers

For years, I had been taking my **twitter account** for my personal **jot noting space**, overloading it with **random thoughts**, sometimes at high velocity as they come in my brain and I need to put them down to discharge it so as to be able to find them later on.

Since I have created a new content format called the [**ReAdABLE Human Format**](http://readablehumanformat.com) I can now blog and organize information more efficiently and stop spamming twitter and so I apologize to my twitter followers for my past behavior :).
